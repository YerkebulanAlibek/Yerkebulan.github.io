You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. <br> You don’t have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. You don’t have to know the second <br> theory of  thermodynamics in physics to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. <br> A soul generated by love</h3>

                In 2015, over 62 million people provided nonprofits their time in the form of volunteerism. These volunteers provided just short of 8 billion hours of service. Remarkable! There is something truly special about being able to contribute to the greater good. Volunteerism has been shown to improve a volunteer’s mood, decrease stress, and increase strength. The benefits of volunteerism are full circle for volunteers and the communities they serve.

                Inspiration comes in all shapes and sizes.  The nonprofit industry as a whole is very inspiring and organizations worldwide are making a difference in the lives of many people and the communities in which they serve. Most nonprofits would not be successful in pursuing their mission without the support of volunteers. Your nonprofit needs to inspire volunteers to motivate them to continue to give.

                With busy lives, it can be hard to find time to volunteer. However, the benefits of volunteering can be enormous. Volunteering offers vital help to people in need, worthwhile causes, and the community, but the benefits can be even greater for you, the volunteer. The right match can help you to find friends, connect with the community, learn new skills, and even advance your career.
