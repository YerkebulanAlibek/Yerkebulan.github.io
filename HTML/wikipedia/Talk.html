<p>The rock band Tool should've been mentioned. At least in the "see also"-part. They claim they chose their name because they wanted their music to <br> be a tool in crying as a way to evolve as a human. They have several referances to lachrymololgy.</p>

pRemoved the disambiguation because it only needs to be used if there is a risk of confusion between topics. It is reasonably clear that a page named tears <br> is about crying, not about "two or more lacerations". See Wikipedia:Disambiguation. It would be tear that could be made a disambiguation page, but the verb to tear will never have its own encyclopedia entry, <br> and there's no risk of confusion with laceration apart from the synonymous dictionary definition.
