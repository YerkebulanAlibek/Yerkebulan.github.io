                Tears are a clear liquid secreted by the <a href="">lacrimal glands</a> (tear gland) found in the <a href="">eyes</a> of all <a href="">land mammals</a>.[1] Tears are made up of water, electrolytes, proteins, lipids, and mucins that form layers on the surface of eyes. <br>[2]  The different types of tears—basal, reflex, and emotional—vary significantly in composition.[2]  The functions of tears include lubricating the eyes (basal tears), removing irritants (reflex tears), <br> and also aiding the immune system. [3] Tears also occur as a part of the body's natural pain response.[4] Emotional secretion of tears may serve a biological function by excreting stress-inducing hormones <br> built up through times of emotional distress.

                     Tears are made up of three layers: lipid, aqueous, and mucous. [7] Tears are composed of water, salts, antibodies, and lysozymes (antibacterial enzymes); though composition varies among different tear types. <br>  The composition of tears caused by an emotional reaction differs from that of tears as a reaction to irritants, such as onion fumes, dust, or allergens. Emotional tears contain higher concentrations of stress hormones <br> such as adrenocorticotropic hormone and leucine enkephalin (a natural pain killer), which suggests that emotional tears play a biological role in balancing stress hormone levels.[8]
